# Performance Round-Based Game

A fast-paced, score-focused action game **inspired by _The Last of Us Part II’s_ “No Return” mode**, where every round challenges you to **defeat a set number of enemies** as efficiently as possible.  
Your **performance** in each round determines your points.

  Each level pits you against a fixed number of enemies.

  - Earn **full points** for completing special objectives:  
    - Take no damage  
    - Finish under a certain time limit  
    - Achieve a set number of melee kills and more
  - Points are collected at the end of each round based on your achievements.

- **6 Levels:**  
  - Progress through all levels without dying to get your **final endscore**.  
  - Compare your score with friends and other players.
